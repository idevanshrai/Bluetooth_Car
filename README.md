**Bluetooth Arduino Car**

This project demonstrates how to build a Bluetooth-controlled car using an Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and two DC motors.

**Key Features:**
- **Bluetooth Control:** Control the car's movement (forward, backward, left, right) using a smartphone or computer with a Bluetooth terminal app.
- **Motor Control:** Uses the L298N motor driver to control the speed and direction of the DC motors.
- **Simple Command Structure:** Commands are sent over Bluetooth using simple characters (F for forward, B for backward, L for left, R for right, S for stop).

**Components Required:**
- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Two DC Motors
- Chassis with Wheels
- Battery Pack
- Jumper Wires

**Getting Started:**
1. **Assemble the Circuit:** Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the Code:** Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
3. **Pair with Bluetooth:** Pair the HC-05 Bluetooth module with your smartphone or computer.
4. **Control the Car:** Use a Bluetooth terminal app to send commands to the Arduino and control the car.

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Add sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
- **Speed Control:** Implement speed control for more precise movement.
- **Remote Camera:** Add a camera to the car and stream the video to a smartphone or computer.
